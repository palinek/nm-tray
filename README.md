# nm-tray

**nm-tray** is a simple [NetworkManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager) front end with information icon residing in system tray (like e.g. nm-applet).
It's a pure Qt application. For interaction with *NetworkManager* it uses API provided by [**KF5::NetworkManagerQt**](https://projects.kde.org/projects/frameworks/networkmanager-qt) -> plain DBus communication.
